    - first about a potential solution by emulating the button press https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/141090
    - second is explanation of how multiplexing works with actual example https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/141088
        - links to http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-access-5-buttons-through-1-Arduino-input/
    - another is how they probed the openeer https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/279059




Dependencies:
- Swift on raspbian https://www.uraimo.com/2018/06/13/A-big-update-on-Swift-4-1-2-for-raspberry-pi-zero-1-2-3/
- Swift server on linux https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect

Process:
1) installed Swift on raspbian using pre-compiled binaries: https://www.uraimo.com/2017/09/06/A-small-update-on-Swift-for-raspberry-pi-zero-1-2-3/
2) Resolve "swift package init
/home/pi/swiftaug17/usr/bin/swift-package: error while loading shared libraries: libpthread_workqueue.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
        -> sudo apt-get install libpthread-workqueue-dev
